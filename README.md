# RigGenNet-and-RigRecogNet

The official code for the paper "Neutral Facial Rigging from Limited Spatiotemporal Meshes"

The full code will be available upon acceptance of the paper.

The generated 3D faces of our RigGenNet：

From left to right: captured true 3D meshes, error colormap drawn on the generated 3D meshes, error colormap drawn on the UV mapping.

The reenacted 3D faces of our RigReconNet (after generation of the RigGenNet) ：

From left to right: captured true 3D meshes, the computed joints, error colormap drawn on the reenacted 3D meshes, error colormap drawn on the UV mapping.
